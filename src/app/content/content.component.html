These valuable life lessons learnt through Kendo may also be applied to the workplace and the school and enhance our contributions to the society. Kendo is not just about sports, it is about developing both the Body and the Spirit of the Kendo-ka. The Penang Kendo Club has adopted the slogan above to exemplify both the simplicity in our aim as well as the depth of meaning in our pursuit of Kendo mastery.</h3>

                   <p>The history of the Penang Kendo Club began in early 2005, when a young boy asked our founder Emi Yamazaki if she knew of any Kendo teachers in Penang. Piqued by curiosity and a naïve fascination for Kendo, we began searching for a Kendo teacher.</p>
                   <p>It was then that a chance meeting with a teacher at the Japanese school in Penang led us to Arimatsu Setsuo Sensei, then a police officer holding a 6th dan in Kendo, who was stationed at the Japanese Consulate in Penang. After recruiting enough students and eventually finding a suitable training ground for Kendo, we finally commenced training in July 2005.</p>
                   <p>Today, we are a MKA affiliated Kendo dojo and have trained over 200 students here in Penang. Led by our current head sensei, Kawaguchi Masahiro (7th Dan Kyoshi), we currently have over 50 active practitioners including more than a dozen Dan-level members and the rest holding a rank between 1st kyu and 7th kyu. Whether you are a seasoned kenshi or a complete novice, we welcome you to practice with us!</p>

              <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12">
                   <p>Born in Tokyo in 1968, Emi had already studied, worked and lived in Japan, US, Singapore, Hong Kong, the UK, China and Kuala Lumpur before finally settling down in Penang with her very young family in 2003.</p>
                   <p>Penang represented a tremendous opportunity for Emi, who loved the idea of starting something cultural and meaningful in rustic, bucolic Penang. Her objective? – to introduce Japanese culture to her own children who would otherwise not have the opportunity to do so living away from Japan. Initially, her intentions were not very altruistic, but as the local Penang people around her started ask her to share more and more about Japanese culture with them, she thought, why not?</p>
                   <p>Enter 2005 a youngster whose name no one ever quite caught… he was a teenager looking to learn kendo and asked Emi over the phone if she could recommend a teacher here. Curious, and seduced by the ‘cool’ image of kendo, Emi started to search for a kendo centre, teachers, practitioners…ANYONE with any kendo experience who was willing to teach. Alas, she found that the last time anyone had picked up a kendo shinai in Penang was 9 years prior! But Emi’s networking brought her to the doorsteps of the Japanese Consulate in Penang where she met Consul Arimatsu Setsuo, a young (30+) 6-dan kendo-ka who was just about to send his whole bougu set back to Japan since there was no kendo activities in Penang. Unfazed, Emi asked if he’d like to teach kendo in Penang… that way, they could set up Penang’s first kendo-club and her 6-year-old son could be member #001, whether or not he wanted to! As luck would have it, he said ‘yes’ and the rest they say, is history!</p>
                   <p>Emi still does not practise kendo herself – she complains it’s too hot to do any sports in Penang. But she loves promoting sports and martial arts and any cultural activity related to Japan and has been awarded a “6-dan in talking” for the amount of explaining and translation she’s had to do for the club! But the founding of the Penang Kendo Club is perhaps one of her proudest and most successful venture, as the club – led by the strong and empathetic leadership of consecutive presidents and the high-level, nurturing skills of our senseis from Japan – has really grown from strength to strength, and almost totally without her!</p>
                   <p>Thanks to a happy confluence of curiosity, blind faith and luck that brought about the formation of Penang Kendo Club, Emi wishes that people will continue to be struck by curiosity for kendo, join the club in blind faith and enjoy all the luck and joys of kendo in Penang, at Penang’s ubiquitous Kendo Club for many, many more years to come!</p>
                   <p>P.S, Life is funny … the kid who asked Emi about kendo never joined the club in the end; Emi’s son who quit after 2 years of constant complaining is now an avid kendo-ka at university in the UK, and soon, we would see a full-circle after 25 years, with the return of the awe-inspiring Arimatsu sensei to join in our current stable of teachers to teach the youngsters of Penang the true joys of Kendo!</p>
